## Answering Questions on Piazza

### Respond Quickly
Try to respond to questions quickly, especially during the first few weeks. We strive to keep the average response time between 25-35 minutes. It is encouraging for student to know that they can ask a question in the middle of working on an assignment and still get help from the instructors.

To assist with this, set notification settings in Piazza to “Real Time”, consider getting the piazza app for push notifications.

### Split the work
Answering questions can be a *lot* of work depending on your class size or if there is an exam or project due soon. Make sure all Instructors are answering questions. 

### Call In The Cavalry
If you see a question that you’re not sure how to answer, **the important thing is to escalate the question by mentioning it in Slack** to draw other instructors’ attention to it. 

### Most common types of questions:

1. The “Do my homework for me” questions
2. Synthesis questions (combining old stuff with new stuff)
3. Unexpected behavior questions
4. Duplicate questions
5. Perfect Questions (Rare)


#### “Do My Homework For Me”

A student will post what they have so far and ask you to tell them how to make it pass

#### Unexpected Behavior

I tried X, and thought Y would happen but Z happened instead.

#### Duplicate Questions

Multiple different students post the same (or a very similar) question. The easy scenario is to link to the first question that was asked and answered. You can do this in Piazza with the @.

From a question you can click a button to copy the link

And in your answer the @7 will link to question.

See @7 for a potential solution.

Sometimes this isn’t always possible…


I think it comes down to how important is the concept behind the question, and will engaging in a (potentionally) lengthy conversation drastically improve their learning?

- Point them in the right direction, clarify the problem that they’re trying to solve, break down the issue somewhat, use examples or point to readings or recordings where the concept was explained. **Don’t solve it for them** (at least not immediately), give ‘em a nudge and then step back and encourage them to try again and follow up with their result.
- If it has a simple answer, answer it and provide enough context so they can ask a follow up question if necessary. Link to a resource where they learned the topic and can read more.

Keep problem-solution ordering in mind when answering questions.
